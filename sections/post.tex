Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation
Programme (grant numbers 634935 and
633784 for BRIDGES and B-CAST
respectively), the European Community’s
Seventh Framework Programme under grant
agreement n$^\circ$ 223175
[HEALTHF2-2009-223175] (COGS), the
National Institutes of Health [CA128978]
and Post-Cancer GWAS initiative [1U19
CA148537, 1U19 CA148065-01 (DRIVE) and
1U19 CA148112 - the GAME-ON initiative],
the Department of Defence
[W81XWH-10-1-0341], and the Canadian
Institutes of Health Research CIHR) for
the CIHR Team in Familial Risks of Breast
Cancer [grant PSR-SIIRI-701]. All studies
and funders as listed in Michailidou K et
al (2013 and 2015) and in Guo Q et al
(2015) are acknowledged for their
contributions.

We thank the International Genomics of
Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) for providing
summary results data for these analyses.
The investigators within IGAP contributed
to the design and implementation of IGAP
and/or provided data but did not
participate in analysis or writing of
this report. IGAP was made possible by
the generous participation of the control
subjects, the patients, and their
families. The i–Select chips was funded
by the French National Foundation on
Alzheimer's disease and related
disorders. EADI was supported by the
LABEX (laboratory of excellence program
investment for the future) DISTALZ grant,
Inserm, Institut Pasteur de Lille,
Université de Lille 2 and the Lille
University Hospital. GERAD was supported
by the Medical Research Council 
(Grant n$^\circ$)
503480), Alzheimer's Research UK (Grant
n$^\circ$ 503176), the Wellcome Trust
(Grant n$^\circ$ 082604/2/07/Z) and
German Federal Ministry of Education and
Research (BMBF): Competence Network
Dementia (CND) grant n$^\circ$ 01GI0102,
01GI0711, 01GI0420. CHARGE was partly
supported by the NIH/NIA grant R01
AG033193 and the NIA AG081220 and AGES
contract N01–AG–12100, the NHLBI grant
R01 HL105756, the Icelandic Heart
Association, and the Erasmus Medical
Center and Erasmus University. ADGC was
supported by the NIH/NIA grants: U01
AG032984, U24 AG021886, U01 AG016976,
and the Alzheimer's Association grant
ADGC–10–196728.

We also thank the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
for their publicly
available GWAS summary statistics
(\url{https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/})
and the
Pickrell Lab at the
New York Genome Center for
their GWAS browser
and GWAX summary statistics

\section{Accession Numbers}

Birdseed genotype files of 914 subject were downloaded
from the Genome Data Commons (GDC)
legacy (GRCh37/hg19) archive
(\url{https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/}).
Processed mRNA/miRNA expression
and CpG methylation data was
accessed from the Firehose repository
from the Broad Institute via FireBrowse
(\url{https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/}) \cite{Weinstein2013TheProject}.
ROS/MAP multiomics data (genotype,
mRNA and miRNA expression, CpG methylation)
was accessed through 
the AMP-AD Knowledge
Portal on Synapse (Synapse ID: syn3219045) \cite{DeJager2018DataResearch}.
